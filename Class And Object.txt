==================================================Class==============================================

In Java, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior (attributes and methods) that the objects created from the class can have. A class encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. It serves as the fundamental building block in object-oriented  programming (OOP) in Java.

What is a Class?
A class in Java is a user-defined data type that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class can possess.

Key Points:
A class is a blueprint for objects.
It defines attributes and methods.
Objects are instances of a class.
Syntax of a Class
The basic syntax to define a class in Java is as follows:

class ClassName {
    // Attributes (data fields)
    dataType attributeName;

    // Constructor
    public ClassName(parameters) {
        // Initialize attributes
    }

    // Methods
    returnType methodName(parameters) {
        // Method body
    }
}

In Java, an object is a fundamental entity in object-oriented  
programming (OOP). An object is an instance of a class that 
encapsulates both state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
 Objects interact with one another through methods, providing
 a way to model real-world entities and their interactions.

What is an Object?
An object is an instance of a class that represents a 
real-world entity or concept. 
It is created based on the blueprint provided by the class 
and has its own identity, state, and behavior.

Identity: Each object has a unique identity, which differentiates it from other objects.
State: The state of an object is represented by its attributes (fields or properties).
Behavior: The behavior of an object is represented by its methods (functions or operations).

Key Points:
-----------
Objects are instances of classes.
They encapsulate state and behavior.
Objects are created using the new keyword in Java.

syntax:

ClassName objectName = new ClassName();
